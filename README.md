# File Data Sync for Neutron Beams 📡🔬  

This repository provides a **Python-based tool** to synchronize data from the **V20 Berlin beamline** to the **European Spallation Source (ESS)** neutron data catalog. It handles data transfer, authentication, reconciliation, and validation for seamless integration into the catalog.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Data Synchronization**: Fetches and syncs neutron beamline data to ESS.  
- **Service Account Authentication**: Ensures secure access to the data catalog.  
- **Reconciliation & Validation**: Verifies the data sync process for accuracy.

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- Python 3.8+  
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`  
  - `pandas`  

Install dependencies:  
pip install requests pandas  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neutron-data-sync.git  
   cd neutron-data-sync  

2. Install dependencies:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. Update the `config.json` file with:  
   - Source and destination details.  
   - ESS service account credentials.  

2. Sync data from V20 to ESS:  
   python sync_data.py  

3. Reconcile and validate synced data:  
   python validate_sync.py
